# OneSpace
## "Curate everything in OneSpace"

Currently, a person might share his/her experiences on different social media platforms as per the appropriateness of different platforms. For instance, a student might share his/her internship or Job update on LinkedIn, food restaurant visit, or traveling experience on Instagram, and share his/her views about current events on Twitter. Our platform will allow users to curate all the experiences in one place.
